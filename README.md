# Domain-Specific Language for Matrix and Vector Manipulation

## Overview

This project is an open-ended design assignment for the course *Programming Languages*, taught by **Prof. Sanjiva Prasad**. The goal is to build a **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** that allows for high-level operations on vectors and matrices, supporting typical linear algebraic computations.

The assignment progresses through the full language design and implementation cycle:

1. **Lexical Analysis** (OCaml-Lex)[Tokenzier Written in the file :- "lexer.mll" and "token.ml"]
2. **Parsing and Grammar Design** (OCaml-Yacc)[Parser can be found in the file :- "parser.mly"]
3. **Type Checker**[Type-Checker can be found in the file:- "type_checker.ml"]
4. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Construction**
5. **Interpreter Implementation**[Interpreter can be found in the file :- "eval.ml"]

---

## Features of the DSL

The language is purpose-built for matrix and vector operations and includes the following:

### ✅ Data Types

* **Primitive types**:

  * `int`, `float`, `bool`
* **Compound types**:

  * `vector[n]`, `matrix[m][n]` (row-major format)

### ✅ Expressions & Operators

* **Scalars**:

  * Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
  * Comparisons: `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
  * Boolean: `&&`, `||`, `!`
* **Vectors**:

  * Construction: `[1, 2, 3]`
  * Operations: `+`, scalar `*`, dot product (`.`), `magnitude`, `dimension`, `angle`
* **Matrices**:

  * Construction: `[[1,2], [3,4]]`
  * Operations: `+`, scalar `*`, matrix multiplication (`*`), `transpose`, `determinant`

### ✅ Control Constructs

* **Assignment**: `x := expr`
* **Blocks**: `{ stmt1; stmt2; ... }`
* **Conditionals**: `if (cond) then stmt else stmt`
* **Loops**:

  * `while (cond) { ... }`
  * `for i = start to end { ... }`

### ✅ Input/Output

* `Input("filename")` – load vector/matrix from file
* `Input()` – read from stdin
* `Print(x)` – output variable

## Interpreter Implementation

The interpreter processes **well-typed Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)** generated by the parser. Key parts of the interpreter:

* `eval_expr`: evaluates expressions
* `eval_stmt`: executes statements
* Runtime environment: maintains current variable bindings

The interpreter gracefully handles:

* Type errors
* Runtime errors (e.g., out-of-bound accesses, mismatched dimensions)
* Syntax errors (from parser/lexer)


---

## Test Suite

The project includes:

### ✅ Correct Test Programs

* Transposing a matrix
* Inverting a matrix
* Determinant calculation
* Dot product of vectors
* Scalar multiplication
* Gaussian elimination (ambitious example)

### ❌ Incorrect Programs

* Ill-typed expressions
* Syntax errors
* Runtime failures (e.g., division by zero, shape mismatch)

These tests are essential to ensure robustness and correctness of the interpreter and this testing is done and can be found in the file named "main.ml".

## Build & Run

### Requirements

* OCaml
* OCamlLex and OCamlYacc

Download this zip folder and run the commands written in the file "running_instructions.txt".

## Notes

* Grammar has been refined to eliminate all **reduce-reduce** and **shift-reduce** conflicts using precedence levels.
* Good error messages are provided at both parsing and runtime stages.
* Code is modular, readable, and thoroughly tested.
